## Description
This week's task was to build a portfolio using my newly acquired React skills, showcasing cutting-edge technologies to stand out from developers with more traditional portfolios.

### User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone SSH git@github.com:lvdean/React-Portfolio.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Next, use the terminal to run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies associated with this application.

To start the server `npm run dev`
